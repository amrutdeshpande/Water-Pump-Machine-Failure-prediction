# Water-Pump-Machine-Failure-prediction
1. Created an automated machine failure prediction solution that monitors data coming in every day and historical data and predicts the chances of failure 30 days in advance to enable the respective stake holders to take necessary action to minimize the loss . 2. Extract the Time series data from MS SQL Server by establishing a link using python, clean the data for discrepancies (outliers, class imbalance etc.), perform EDA and define baseline metrics . 3. Built &amp; trained Machine learning models like LSTM, RNN, Decision Trees and optimized their parameters to increase their accuracy and execution efficiency. The prediction result is then pushed into a UI built on Visual Studio &amp; Tableau Dashboard to enable for easy consumption by the stake holders.
